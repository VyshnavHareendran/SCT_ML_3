# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This is **Task 2** of my internship at *Skill Craft Technology*.  
This project applies image classification using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** on deep features extracted from the **MobileNetV2** model. The goal is to classify images into either **Cat** or **Dog** using a traditional ML classifier with the power of deep learning features.

Project Features
- Image loading and preprocessing using OpenCV
- Feature extraction using pretrained **MobileNetV2** (transfer learning)
- Training a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** on extracted features
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Prediction on new custom images

Dataset
This project uses the [Kaggle Cats vs Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)

**Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size.
